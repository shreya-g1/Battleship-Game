# Battleship-Game
Rules
```
You will be playing against the computer. Each of you has a grid with 5 ships on it:
- CARRIER (size-- 5 blocks)
- BATTLESHIP (size-- 4 blocks) 
- CRUISER (size-- 3 blocks) 
- SUBMARINE (size-- 3 blocks) 
- DESTROYER (size-- 2 blocks)
```
```
The objective of the game is to sink all 5 ships by correctly guessing the position of the ship 
tiles. If you guess a ship tile correctly, it will be displayed as '▣' on the opponent's grid. 
If you guess incorrectly, the tile will display '☒'. Whoever sinks all the ships on the opponent's 
grid first, wins.
```
```
You will be prompted as to whether you would like to play the multifire or normal version of the 
game. Normal means each player gets one shot each turn. Multifire means the number of shots you 
get each round is determined by the number of ships you still have afloat.
